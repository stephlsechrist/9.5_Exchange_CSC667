# 9.5 Exchange
This is a group project for CSC667 in which we used Kafka, Docker, mongoDB, Redis, NodeJS, Bootstrap, and other technologies to create a full stack web application. It is a simple e-commerce application.

# TO RUN

mongoDB, docker, and redis must be running

The MongoDB database for this applications is named FinalProject95

* To test the various features of the application you will need to create both a buyer and a seller account 
  from the registration page.

* Only buyers can select 'purchase' which will only be shown if a buyer is logged in on each individual item page.
* Only sellers can post items from their dashboard.
* Sellers must re-enter the page to see a recently posted item under 'Listed Items'
